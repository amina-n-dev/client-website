        About the 2020 World Justice Forum
        In 2020, WJP devoted its Forum to the global effort to deliver on the promise of "justice for all" of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 16. Access to justice is a fundamental component of rule of law, and the failure of justice systems to meet justice needs compounds inequality and erodes trust in institutions.
        
        The 2020 Forum gathered our community for a challenging and inspiring four days to strengthen our understanding of the justice gap, identify solutions, and motivate action for change. Highlights of the event included the launch of the Justice for All report, which revealed new data (as featured in World Justice Project's Measuring the Justice Gap report) showing that 5 billion people have unmet justice needs globally. The launch of the report sparked new thinking on the opportunity for a people-centered approach and the need for global action to close the justice gap. In response, governments, organizations, and individuals joined in showcasing their justice initiatives and Commitments to Justice at the conclusion of the World Justice Forum. 
        
        The 2020 World Justice Forum additionally showcased practical solutions to addressing and closing the justice gap. From interactive working sessions to plenaries highlighting solutions for increasing access to justice to fast pitch presentations from World Justice Challenge finalists, participants gained knowledge and insight from multi-sector actors making an impact.
